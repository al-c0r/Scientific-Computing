# Numerical-PDE
In this repository I've added all my codes which solves a given Partial Differential Equation (PDE) numerically.
All the codes are written in MatLab.
Requires one to specify the boundary conditions.
1) Finite_diff1.m is about solving PDE involving 1 space dimension and 1 time dimension.
2) Finite_diff1b.m is about solving PDE involving 3 spatial coordinate and 1 time dimension.
3) Same as 1) but with animation to visualise the behaviour of function using Finite_diff2.m
4) The above 3 are iterative approach where one computes from boundary while Finite_diff3a.m method is building a matrix and inverting it does the same job as 1) other files of diff3 does the same job but little different way.
